Angular 2 Core Concepts
=======================

We use components to figure parts / sections of our single-page apps.

Imports are awesome because we don't worry about ordering any more. They also
help compress our js files.

Services replace a number of concepts in angular.

Con: There is a completely different syntax, but it's easy to learn
(supposedly).

TypeScript is the massive china polandball that has ES6 ES7 (and of course
ES5).
